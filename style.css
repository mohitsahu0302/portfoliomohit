/*
 * Note on Responsiveness:
 * Tailwind CSS handles responsiveness primarily through utility class prefixes
 * (e.g., `md:text-lg`, `lg:grid-cols-3`).
 * This `style.css` file would primarily be for non-Tailwind specific responsive
 * adjustments if needed, or if a global CSS property needs to be applied differently
 * across breakpoints outside of Tailwind's system.
 *
 * Example (uncomment if needed, but Tailwind classes are preferred):
 * @media (max-width: 768px) {
 * .container {
 * padding-left: 1rem;
 * padding-right: 1rem;
 * }
 * .nav-link {
 * padding: 8px 12px;
 * font-size: 0.9rem;
 * }
 * }
